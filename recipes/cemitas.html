<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
    Cemitas are a Mexican sandwich that originally hails from the State of Puebla. This recipe shows you how to make a Pueblan-style cemita with a fried milanesa beef. This recipe is loaded 
    with Quesillo and a style of different toppings. It can range from lettuce to tomatoes. The one showed above is personally made by my mother. It includes all the regular recipe items but 
    with a twist to it. Potatoes are added to it to give them a distinct taste. These cemitas are a staple food in her native home state of Puebla.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Sesame Seed Buns</li>
    <li>Avocados</li>
    <li>Chipotle</li>
    <li>Lettuce</li>
    <li>Breaded milanesa beef</li>
    <li>Tomato</li>
    <li>Quesillo</li>

</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Set wire rack on a sheet pan. Place milk in a shallow dish. Place flour in another shallow dish. Place bread crumbs in third shallow dish. 
        Working one at a time, dip cutlets in milk, then dredge in flour, shaking off excess. Return to milk, then dredge in bread crumbs, pressing to adhere. 
        Place breaded cutlets on a baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Heat about 1/2 inch oil in a cast-iron skillet to 375Â°F. Working in batches and adding oil as needed to maintain level, fry cutlets, turning once, 
        until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to a clean paper-towel-lined baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper when still hot.</li>
    <li>Spread avocado on bottom bun halves. Top with fried cutlets. Mound half of the cheese on the cutlets.</li>
    <li>Top with lettuce and mound the remaining cheese on top. Drizzle with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Scoop some bread from each of the top buns and discard. Close sandwiches and serve right away.</li>
